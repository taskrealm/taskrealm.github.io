<h2>The TaskRealm terms & conditions outline TaskRealm's and Your obligations and responsibilities on the TaskRealm Platform.</h2>

<p> Agreement: www.taskrealm.com</p>
<h4>TaskRealm operates an online platform allowing Users to connect through the TaskRealm Platform with other Users who provide Services.</h4>

<h4>Please read these terms and all Policies including the Community Guidelines  and Privacy Policy carefully before using the TaskRealm Platform. These Policies are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.</h4>

<p>All defined terms in this Agreement have the meaning given to them in the TaskRealm Glossary(scroll down until you reach it).</p>

<h2>! AT THIS TIME NOT ALL FUNCTIONALITIES/ SERVICES SPECIFIED ARE AVAILABLE !</h2>

<h3>1. SCOPE OF TaskRealm SERVICES</h3>
<h4>Basic Principles</h4>
<p>1.1 TaskRealm provides the TaskRealm Platform to enable Posters to publish Posted Tasks.</p>
<p>1.2 Workers may make an Offer in response to a Posted Task. Some parts of Offer details may be made publicly available, including to internet users who are not Users.</p>
<p>1.3 A Poster may revoke or modify a Posted Task at any time before he/she accepts an Offer. TaskRealm reserves the right to cancel all Offers on a Posted Task made prior to the modification.</p>
<p>1.4 If a Poster accepts an Offer on the TaskRealm Platform, a Task Contract is created between the Worker and the Poster.</p>
<p>1.5 Upon creation of a Task Contract, the Poster must pay the Agreed Price into the Payment Account.</p>
<p>1.6 Upon creation of the Task Contract, TaskRealm has rendered TaskRealm Services and the Service Fee is due and payable.</p>
<p>1.7 Once the Task Contract is created, the Worker and Poster may vary the Task Contract on the TaskRealm Platform. The Poster and Worker are encouraged to use TaskRealm's private messaging system to amend or vary the Task Contract (including the Agreed Price) or to otherwise communicate.</p>
<p>1.8 Once the Services are complete, the Worker must provide notice of that on the TaskRealm Platform.</p>
<p>1.9 Once the Services are complete, the Poster must provide notice of that on the TaskRealm Platform.</p>
<p>1.10 Once the Posted Task has been completed and the Poster confirms the Services are completed, or if TaskRealm is satisfied the Services have been completed, the Worker Funds will be released by TaskRealm from the Payment Account to the Worker. However this process does not apply to the payment of Recurring Services which is addressed in clause 1.20 below.</p>
<p>1.11 After the Task Contract is completed, the parties are encouraged to review and provide feedback of the Services on the TaskRealm Platform.</p>
<h4>Search Assist</h4>
<p>1.12 TaskRealm may also provide a Search Assist feature enabling Posters to submit an Offer for Services.</p>
<p>1.13 An Offer submitted by a Poster using Search Assist may be notified to other Users and such Users may elect to make an Instant Claim of it.</p>
<p>1.14 When using Search Assist a Task Contract is created when a Worker makes an Instant Claim (and in the case of Recurring Services a Task Contract is created for the first Occurrence only). For Recurring Services, the next Task Contract is created upon completion of the previous Occurrence.</p>
<p>1.15 A Poster may revoke or modify its Offer in using Search Assist, including for Recurring Services, at any time before a Worker makes an Instant Claim. TaskRealm reserves the right to cancel all Posted Tasks made prior to the revocation or modification.</p>
<h4>Worker Listing</h4>
<p>1.16 TaskRealm may also provide a Worker Listing feature enabling Workers to publish Offers for Services.</p>
<p>1.17 TaskRealm may publish Worker Listings from time to time in its absolute discretion.</p>
<p>1.18 A Poster may request to book a Worker Listing by clicking on the Request Booking button and completing the booking request. The Worker may then make an offer to perform the Task. When using Worker Listing, a Task Contract is created when the Poster accepts the offer made by the Worker.</p>
<p>1.19 A Worker may revoke or modify its Worker Listing at any time before a Poster accepts a Worker's offer.</p>
<h4>Recurring Service</h4>
<p>1.20 For Recurring Services and subject to clause 1.21, once the Occurrence has been completed and the Worker confirms the Occurrence is completed (or if TaskRealm is satisfied the Occurrence is completed) then the Worker Funds for that Occurrence will automatically be released by TaskRealm from the Payment Account to the Worker.</p>
<p>1.21 The Poster may elect to pause automatic payment of Worker Funds for an Occurrence within 24 hours from when the Worker confirms the Occurrence is completed. If the Poster pauses such automatic payment in accordance with this clause, then the Worker Funds will not be released by TaskRealm from the Payment Account to the Worker until the Poster also confirms that the Occurrence is completed.</p>
